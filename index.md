Using Indego’s trip data, I developed a spatio-temporal model to predict ridership demand. The model was trained on data from the first three weeks of July 2021 and tested on data from the last week of July and the first week of August 2021.

For planning workshop, our group proposed several strategies over a 20-year timeline to incorporate the District’s strengths in the
addressment of its existing challenges: developing complete streets infrastructure; improving access to both public transit
and cycling options; expanding transitional housing; establishing a federal credit union; creating a community land trust;
implementing a storefront tenant support organization; improving both the quality of, and equitable access to, green space;
helping residents navigate the process of phased managed retreat to address the threat of sea level rise; and implementing
educational programs around disaster preparedness. [here](https://upenn.app.box.com/s/visk40didyr7tt4s5sioq10owt05dyy7).

# Writing Samples
*Drawing on my experience as a project officer at the Philippines' Department of Transportation, I wrote a teaching case on the Philippines' flagship Public Utility Vehicle Modernization Program. View the case study [here](/pdf/Teachingcase.pdf). 

*As a research associate at a think tank, I regularly contributed opinion articles to a leading business newspaper in the Philippines. My first op-ed, [Can We Spend, Spend, Spend?](https://www.bworldonline.com/can-spend-spend-spend/),looks at the government's plan to intorduce new taxes to finance its ambitious infrastructure program.
