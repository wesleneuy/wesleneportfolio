## Thesis
The purpose of this project is to estimate a predictive model that yields predictions in space interpreted as ‘the probability that an area will be inundated with flood water”. You will train and validate your model on Calgary and then predict for a comparable city. The 3D visualization below was produced using Rayshader in R.
