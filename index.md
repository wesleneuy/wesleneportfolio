<img src="images/bikeshare.jpg?raw=true"/>
Using Indegoâ€™s trip data, I developed a spatio-temporal model that could help predict ridership demand. The model was trained on data from the first three weeks of July 2021 and tested on data from the last week of July and the first week of August 2021.

# Writing Samples
*Drawing from my experience as a project officer at the Philippines' Department of Transportation, I wrote a teaching case on the Philippines' flagship Public Utility Vehicle Modernization Program. View the case study [here](/pdf/Teachingcase.pdf). 

*As a research associate at a think tank, I regularly contributed opinion articles to a leading business newspaper in the Philippines. My first op-ed, [Can We Spend, Spend, Spend?](https://www.bworldonline.com/can-spend-spend-spend/), looks at the government's plan to introduce new taxes to finance its ambitious infrastructure program.
